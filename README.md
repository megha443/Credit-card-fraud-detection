**Credit Card Fraud Detection**

This repository contains a project aimed at detecting fraudulent transactions in credit card data using Python and Machine Learning techniques. 
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle, and due to the nature of the data being unlabeled, the Isolation Forest algorithm was 
employed for anomaly detection.

**Project Overview**

Credit card fraud detection is an important problem in financial services. Identifying fraudulent transactions early can help prevent massive 
financial losses. Since the dataset used in this project is mostly unlabeled, we utilized an unsupervised learning approach.

In this project, we apply the Isolation Forest algorithm to detect outliers, which we assume are fraudulent transactions. The Isolation Forest algorithm 
is particularly well-suited for anomaly detection as it isolates anomalies rather than profiling normal data points.

**Dataset**

The dataset for this project was sourced from Kaggle, which contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. It is highly imbalanced,
with fraudulent transactions accounting for only a small fraction of the total.

Number of Transactions: 284,807
Number of Fraudulent Transactions: 492
Features: 30 features including Time, Amount, and anonymized features V1, V2, ..., V28.
**Algorithms Used**
Isolation Forest: This unsupervised machine learning algorithm detects anomalies in a dataset. It works by isolating observations by randomly selecting features and splitting 
values between the maximum and minimum range of the selected features.
Why Isolation Forest?
The dataset is unlabeled, which means traditional supervised algorithms like Logistic Regression or Random Forests cannot be directly applied. Since we are looking to detect anomalies (fraudulent transactions), Isolation Forest is ideal as it isolates anomalies during the process of random sampling and splitting.

**Usage**

Download the dataset from Kaggle and place it in the data/ directory. The link to the dataset is provided here.

Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python scripts to preprocess the data, train the Isolation Forest model, and evaluate the results.

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Or, run the main Python script:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
The model will detect potential fraudulent transactions based on the anomaly score generated by the Isolation Forest algorithm.

**Results**

The results of the project include:

Detection of fraudulent transactions with a reasonable degree of accuracy using unsupervised learning.
Visualization of the anomaly scores for both fraudulent and legitimate transactions.
Evaluation metrics such as Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
